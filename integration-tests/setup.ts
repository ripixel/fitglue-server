  // Actually, our code keys execution ID as:
  // Enricher: "{userId}-{timestamp}"
  // Router: "router-{userId}-{timestamp}"
  // Uploader: "uploader-{userId}-{timestamp}"

  // We can't wildcard delete. We will assume for this simple test suite that checking clean wiring matters most.
  // Ideally we would query a "userId" field on executions, but we didn't add one explicitly to the root of the doc, only inside 'inputs' map.
  // For now: Skip execution cleanup to avoid complexity, or try to list collection and filter manually (slow).
  // Let's implement GCS cleanup as it's more important for cost/storage.
