# Manual Integration QA Guide

This guide describes the complete workflow to configure and verify the FitGlue integration pipeline directly. It covers the new Pipeline Architecture, allowing for flexible routing like `Hevy -> Fitbit HR -> Strava`.

## Prerequisites

-   Access to `fitglue-admin` CLI.
-   A running Dev environment (or access to Prod via correct GCloud project selection).
-   User's **Hevy API Key** (from Hevy App Settings -> API).
-   **Client IDs** for Strava and Fitbit (from your developer portals).

## 1. User Setup

### Step 1: Create the User & Ingress Key
Create a new user. This establishes their identity and secure ingress.

```bash
./fitglue-admin users:create
```

1.  **Copy the User ID** (e.g., `user-123`).
2.  **Generate Ingress Key**: Select "Yes".
3.  **Label**: e.g., "Manual Test".
4.  **Copy the Ingress Key** (`fg_sk_...`).

### Step 2: Configure Hevy Integration
Set the user's Hevy API Key to enable data fetching.

```bash
./fitglue-admin users:configure-hevy user-123
```
*Enter the user's personal Hevy API Key.*

### Step 3: Configure Hevy Webhook
Add the webhook in the Hevy App or Dashboard.

-   **URL**: `https://[env].fitglue.tech/hooks/hevy` (e.g., `https://dev.fitglue.tech/hooks/hevy`)
-   **Secret**: Paste the **Ingress Key** from Step 1.

### Step 4: Connect OAuth Services
Generate auth links for the user to authorize Strava and Fitbit.

**Connect Strava:**
```bash
./fitglue-admin users:connect user-123 strava
```
*Prompts for Client ID. Enter your Strava Client ID.*
*Visit the generated URL to authorize.*

**Connect Fitbit:**
```bash
./fitglue-admin users:connect user-123 fitbit
```
*Prompts for Client ID. Enter your Fitbit Client ID.*
*Visit the generated URL to authorize.*

## 2. Pipeline Configuration

This is the core new feature. Instead of hardcoded routing, we define a pipeline.

### Scenario: Hevy -> Fitbit HR -> Strava

We want Hevy workouts to be enriched with Fitbit heart rate data and then sent to Strava.

```bash
./fitglue-admin users:add-pipeline user-123
```

1.  **Source**: Select `SOURCE_HEVY`.
2.  **Enrichers**:
    *   Select `Yes` to add an enricher.
    *   Choose `fitbit-heart-rate`.
    *   (Optional) Inputs: Press Enter to skip (defaults are fine).
    *   Select `No` to stop adding enrichers.
3.  **Destinations**: Check `strava`.

**Result**: A pipeline ID is generated. The system is now configured to listen for Hevy webhooks for this user, fetch HR from Fitbit, and upload to Strava.

## 3. Verification

### Trigger a Workout
1.  **Real**: Finish a workout in Hevy.
2.  **Simulation**: Use Postman or curl to send a dummy webhook event to `https://dev.fitglue.tech/hooks/hevy` with the `X-Hevy-Webhook-Secret` header set to your Ingress Key.

### Trace Execution

**1. Check Hevy Handler:**
```bash
./fitglue-admin executions:list -s hevy-handler -u user-123
```
*   **Status**: Should be `STATUS_SUCCESS`.
*   **Output**: Note the message ID for tracking through the pipeline.

**2. Check Enricher:**
```bash
./fitglue-admin executions:list -s enricher -u user-123
```
*   **Status**: Should be `STATUS_SUCCESS`.
*   **Log Messages to verify**:
    *   `"Starting enrichment"` - Confirms the enricher received the activity.
    *   `"Retrieved Fitbit HR"` - Shows Fitbit heart rate data was successfully fetched (includes `points` and `duration`).
    *   `"Published enriched event"` - Confirms the enriched activity was published (includes `activity_id`, `pipeline_id`, `destinations`, and `message_id`).
    *   `"Enrichment complete"` - Final confirmation with `published_count`.
*   **Output JSON fields to verify**:
    *   `"status": "SUCCESS"`
    *   `"published_count": 1` - Should match the number of pipelines configured.
    *   `"published_events"` - Array containing:
        *   `activity_id` - The activity identifier.
        *   `pipeline_id` - The pipeline that was executed.
        *   `destinations` - Should include `["strava"]`.
        *   `applied_enrichments` - Should include `["fitbit-hr"]`.
        *   `fit_file_uri` - GCS URI where the enriched FIT file is stored.
        *   `pubsub_message_id` - Message ID for the next stage.
    *   `"provider_executions"` - Details about each enricher that ran:
        *   `provider_name`: `"fitbit-hr"`
        *   `status`: `"SUCCESS"`
        *   `metadata`: Should include `"hr_source": "fitbit"` and `"hr_points"` count.

**3. Check Router:**
```bash
./fitglue-admin executions:list -s router -u user-123
```
*   **Status**: Should be `STATUS_SUCCESS`.
*   **Log Messages to verify**:
    *   `"Starting routing"` - Shows the router received the enriched event (includes `source` and `pipeline`).
    *   `"Resolved destinations from payload"` - Should show `dests=["strava"]`.
    *   `"Routed to destination"` - Confirms routing to each destination (includes `dest`, `topic`, and `message_id`).
    *   `"Routing complete"` - Final confirmation with `routed_count`.
*   **Output JSON fields to verify**:
    *   `"status": "SUCCESS"`
    *   `"activity_id"` - The activity identifier.
    *   `"pipeline_id"` - The pipeline being executed.
    *   `"source"` - Should be `"SOURCE_HEVY"`.
    *   `"applied_enrichments"` - Should include `["fitbit-hr"]`.
    *   `"routed_destinations"` - Array containing:
        *   `destination`: `"strava"`
        *   `topic`: The Pub/Sub topic used.
        *   `pubsub_message_id` - Message ID for tracking.
        *   `status`: `"SUCCESS"`

**4. Check Strava Uploader:**
```bash
./fitglue-admin executions:list -s strava-uploader-job -u user-123
```
*   **Status**: Should be `STATUS_SUCCESS`.
*   **Log Messages to verify**:
    *   `"Starting upload"` - Shows the uploader received the event (includes `activity_id` and `pipeline_id`).
    *   `"Upload success"` - Confirms successful upload to Strava (includes `upload_id` and `status`).
*   **Output JSON fields to verify**:
    *   `"status": "SUCCESS"`
    *   `"strava_upload_id"` - The Strava upload identifier.
    *   `"strava_activity_id"` - The Strava activity ID (may be `0` if still processing).
    *   `"upload_status"` - Typically `"Your activity is still being processed."` or `"Your activity is ready."`.
    *   `"activity_id"` - The original activity identifier.
    *   `"pipeline_id"` - The pipeline that was executed.
    *   `"fit_file_uri"` - GCS URI of the uploaded FIT file.
    *   `"activity_name"` - Name of the activity.
    *   `"activity_type"` - Type of activity (e.g., `"WeightTraining"`).
*   **Final Verification**: The activity should appear in the user's Strava feed within a few minutes.

## 4. Troubleshooting

*   **"Provider not found":** Ensure the enricher name in the pipeline (`fitbit-heart-rate`) matches the registered provider name in `enricher/function.go`.
*   **No executions listed:** Check Cloud Logging in GCP Console for `fitglue-server-dev` for lower-level infrastructure errors (e.g., 500 errors, timeouts).
*   **OAuth Failures:** Verify the Callback URL matches *exactly* what is registered in your Strava/Fitbit developer portal settings (must include `https` and the correct environment subdomain).
